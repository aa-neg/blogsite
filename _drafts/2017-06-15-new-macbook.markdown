Well I had originally got some flak from deciding to buy a 12 inch macbook 2017 to perform all of my development tasks. My opinion may change in the future however for the past week it has been an awesome experience.

Firstly computing power is required for development is severely overrated. Unless you really really need some crazy IDE set-up for your monolithic java mess and you must run it locally, then you probably don't need much more than what the macbook offers. Since all i will be using is iterm2 and vim for my editing requirements and none of my side projects are giant beasts that i run locally this isn't an issue. 

#### Why not just have a linux box?

I love the options available within the linux ecosystem. However i do plan to dabble in some mobile development so just having a mac and xcode is a big advantage. Secondly apple in my opinion is the best computer hardware manufacturer in the world, so yes it is probably a waste of money but there isn't a computer with the same form factor and build quality like the macbook.
