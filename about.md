Hello I'm Arnold Agus. I am currently working as a software engineer in Sydney and the co-founder of [Todemy](https://todemy.com)

I decided at the beginning of 2015 to start learning how to code from a statistics background and was fortunate to find after 6 months work as a software developer.

Here are my ramblings. . .
