Hello I'm Arnold Agus. I currently work for Dataprocessors as a software developer in Sydney. 

I decided at the beginning of 2015 to start learning how to code with no prior knowledge and was fortunate to find after 6 months work as a software developer. Here are my ramblings on what I have learned and some of the obstacles I have went through in hopes that others who are in a similar position in their journey can use.
