  So this is just another blog. I guess I'd firstly introduce myself but before that why even bother producing any content here? 

  I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity learn 'programming' on the job and hope to help others who may possibly be interested in learning. I'd be writing a bout any milestone 'eureka' moments and my suggestions, tips on how to start their own journey on learning the vast amount of knowledge that is constantly expanding. 

  How did I start learning?

  As of writing this post its been just a year since I first decided to embark on this task of learning. I enrolled in a postgraduate course at the beginning of 2015 with close to no prior knowledge and began learning how to produce logical commands and make content. 

  Simple tutorial questions which had two line solutions took me several hours producing over complicated solutions which kinda did the job. Although I was coding and studying several hours a week I felt this wasn't the best way to learn at all. Concepts were introduced however (as with the current education system) I felt the scope of why this was useful was not really demonstrated. This is of course easier said than done as to introduce concepts it is quite the logical choice to simply demonstrate academic examples. 

  It was only till during my second semester where I was lucky enough to get full time work and have the chance to start my own software project for the company from scratch did I really start to learn. It was a simple web interface that interacted with a python script and provided an interface to execute various command line arguments from the script. For example rather than 'listing' the table all the time this would be left as a view. Given the fact my first semester of my degree introduced python I wrote a simple back-end server with Flask and had the front-end written with angularJS. 

  Of course this piece of software was quite horrendous and had many many many flaws (so many that it would be an entire post). However I had learned more from this experience over the two week period it took me to complete than I did during my entire first semester. 

  Why?

  Well there were more concepts introduced at university however I never really got to understand them completely. Sure I could reproduce some exam questions however it didn't encourage me to learn further on the topics. This is what I feel is required to really learn and enjoy this craft. You really must try to find a simple project or task to complete and enjoy doing so. Make a blog site with templates maybe make one with Jekyll (like this one). Make a calculator and host it on the web. Make it interactive learn to set up a back-end server etc. 

  So what really engaged my learning was how the content was presented. I needed in my case a project to make me want to read more and try out different languages. This is what I would recommend to start learning. You'll need to learn the very basics however the first goal is to find and try a project that will ignite and fuel your desire to learn. 

  Regardless of how you learn or how you begin your journey in developing this skill. I honestly think the most important factor is to find a project / topic / subject that you are really interested in as the goal is to encourage you to continue learning as, although I am still quite new in my journey I can see that there is always going to be more and more to learn.
