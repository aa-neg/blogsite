As a task in learning golang I decided to make a 'simple' command line tool which would allow you to alias various directories and teleport to them.  This however turned into something quite complicated however I finally produced a working version. https://github.com/aa-neg/golang-teleporter

Firstly there were many issues just writing golang. I noticed many of the design patterns were rather foreign to me and my code become harder to understand. This was through both the syntax being unfamiliar and also my knowledge of the language left me with more complicated code. With the majority of the programming done in python and javascript I was used to the concept of dynamically typed languages and everything being a hash dictionary. It was clear that my solutions to the various problems needed some tweaking to be written in golang. I noticed as I was working through this how I noticed that golang probably wasn't the best correct tool for the job but towards the end I started to see some merit to the language.

Being a complied language there were many benefits during development where my IDE (started trying visual studio code) would be able to tell me complication errors before any execution occured. It also encourged stylistically to handle errors. I really did like the fact that when declaring functions you had the option to declare the input types and output types. This made me actually think about what the intended purpose of my function was going to be. 

I'll be trying to think of another possibly slightly larger project to attempt as I can see many benefits from learning golang.
