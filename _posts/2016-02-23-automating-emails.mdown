I have been fortunate to join the team at Hypothesis and am looking forward to being exposed the client side of the industry.

Doing so however I have started adding sorting rules for my email and this could be a great opportuntiy for a minor side project organsing and interacting with the outlook api (Not sure if this is possible). 

I have also been adjusting my current work environment for windows (it seems to be a never ending journey). The current set-up is sublime with several plugins (vim-keys, seti-ui) and bug.n autohotkey set-up to create a 'tiling window manager' for windows. The overal set-up is currently working fine and it seems there are quite a few jobs (corporate) which depend on a windows environment. 

With the ubuntu bash hopefully having 256 color support in the future the environment is greatly improving. However there is still much scope to compete with other similar offerings (Osx). I still believe a linux distro would usually be the better option due to the ability to customize and choose exactly what the developer is after. Both windows and Osx in my eyes offer an almost complete solution with minimal customization and a larger user base. 

One of the larger problems I have been finding these days is actually finding interesting problems that i care about enough to write and learn solutions for. So far most of my interest has been in implementing various card game simulations however this may change in the future as currently this is due to the fact my colleagues play these various games during lunch. I am hoping to find something larger that could occupy me for a couple of months and hopefully grow into something public facing.
