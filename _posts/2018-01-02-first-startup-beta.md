So just today after a week of waiting my facebook messenger app was approved and this was the last external dependency for my first start-up beta launch!

[Todemy](https://todemy.com)

Like almost everyone who is making a start-up I would like it to work out but the journey so far has been quite fun regardless. I love making product and this was no exception. We were also approved for the AWS activate credits (google gives more money away but AWS just have the best serverless product suite imo)! I'll be definitely writing about some of the technical challenges and maybe even do a quick run down of the infrastructure and more interesting aspects of the code.

Regardless only 1 last piece to build before we can make the first dollar... payments. But its exciting non the less to have something that will be released to atleast validate our idea.
