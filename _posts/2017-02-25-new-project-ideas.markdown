After working through some java at work I have finally decided on a couple of new projects to start. 

#### A Music player

Well my usual music workflow is I would upload into my google folder which would then sync onto my phone. Previously this was done manually using my iphone and itunes. Most of the time I want a big change and have a new cycle of songs and music. However I find the current system not playing well as google play seems buggy (when opening the app it gets confused with 'now playing' and 'music library') and you can't easily find your recently added music. 

The idea would be to have the app upload music from a folder (writing a sync service) then provide me music library sorting based on recently added (I don't really use or like the whole playlist idea). In the future I might move my music into an s3 bucket so I could achieve exactly what google has. The app would be able to sort and play music exactly how I plan to consume (also could help me purge songs which haven't been played in a while or have less than a certain number of hits). 

#### Email aggregation tool

Now this probably already exists but this is more for myself to use. I have separate emails for different purposes , one for spam, personal and work (which happens to be 2 sets). I just want to write a simple app that will query and refresh all of these API's and put all the emails in one place. There are some considerations for storing all of the passwords and keys which I still haven't completely decided upon. 

But these two ideas would be interesting and practical projects which both have different concepts to learn (and potentially I could use different languages). I guess lets see how this goes.
