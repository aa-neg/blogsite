Well title might be slightly misleading but the past 2 weekends I decided to dedicate myself to creating an initial proof of concept dating app inspiried from a co-worker. I had had time to think and plan in the morning and afternoon what i would acomplish (trying to utilize the positives of agile without the fluff) and execute. The first weekend went great I had integrated a simple multi-page react native app with google's firebase. 

However ignoring all the tech during the next week I had time to think. 
> Did I really want to spend my time working on this app?
The truth was no. I was interested in the concept of learning the technology and the concept of building the app from scratch but the app itself was no longer interesting. The truth was originially i thought it would be easy to mock something together (2 months i thought?) and then get to market and start but the core concept and market the app would be in wasn't that interesting anymore. I knew the pains of growing and improving the service and I guess there was no real cause for what I was building. Just something that would be 'fun'.  

I was no longer inspired to work on and complete the app. It was quite pathetic really I was just all into the entire new hype of new technology which made sense. Another issue I found was that my app wasn't really helping people. Well sure it would provide value to some but it wasn't something I could get up every morning and be excited about. 

In the end I will still see it through to prototype phase however I think i'll just slowly iterate when the drive is there (could be quite a while till this is finished). As regardless if I create the product or not there is plenty of value in learning the technology and setting up projects such that I could easily continue where i left off. One of the disadvantages with many different tech stacks is getting back into it 'cold' and being easily able to start work without having to worry in my head the entire stack of issues (hmm that button doesn't look quite right maybe i'll pause my backend work to fix it...).

What I learned was that it is important to just start regardless as you won't know most of the challenges or possibly enjoyment coming without starting. I think it is also forming a good habit to just be able to start things as that is usually the largest barrier to entry. I do have another idea I have been working on and maybe it's time to settle down and stop being so ADHD and commit but atleast not for now :).
